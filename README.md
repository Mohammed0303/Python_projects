# Python Youtube Video Downloader 
Python Youtube Video Downloader is just a GUI Youtube video downloader application which is less than 40 lines of code.

I have explained this program in every single line to make it more easy and understandable for everyone.

I have Created two entry widgets, one is to ask the user to enter the URL or link of a YouTube video and the other is to add the link to download.

Then, i have called the download function using the "Download Video" button.

The module i have used to download the video from the link is a YouTube module i.e. pytube module.
You can download the pytube module by using "pip install pytube" but is this module throws an error then you should try installing "pytube3" in the terminal.
